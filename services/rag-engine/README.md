# RAG Engine Service

Python-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) service for intelligent Q&A.

## Features

- Vector database integration using FAISS
- Document indexing and embedding
- Natural language query processing
- Context-aware responses using LangChain and OpenAI
- WebSocket client for real-time communication with backend

## Tech Stack

- Python
- LangChain
- FAISS for vector search
- OpenAI API
- WebSocket client
- JSON structured logging

## Architecture

The RAG engine uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach:

1. Documents are processed, embedded, and stored in FAISS
2. User queries are embedded and used to retrieve relevant context
3. Retrieved context and the query are sent to LLM for generating responses
4. Responses are streamed back to the user via WebSocket
